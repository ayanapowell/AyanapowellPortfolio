					<h1>Hello,</h1>
					<p>My name is Ayana, I'm a aspiring developer, designer and creator. Sitting at my dad's house in Bowie Maryland, with nothing around but suburban houses and suburban children doing what suburban children do my brother shoved a laptop in front of me, downloaded a text editor said "what else is there to do?" That was a year ago, and now here I am, attending Epicodus- a code bootcamp learning information that I didn't know existed.</p>
					<p>Before attending here, I spent the year since suburbia on my laptop almost everyday just building website. I started horrible of course, but every project was better than the last. During my year of self-teaching, I picked up HTML, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap, and a little Javascript; I've implemented them in my personal projects as well. My passion is only just beginning, and everyday the momentum builds. I think that's a huge reason as to why I decided to attend Epicous- I wanted a place I could code, all day and everyday.</p>
					<p>There's still so much to learn, I can only imagine the things these 10 fingers of mine will build oneday..</p>
